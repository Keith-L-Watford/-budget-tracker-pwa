# Budget Tracker (Progressive Web Application)

## Description
I was assigned to add offline functionality to a Budget Tracker application. It was a pretty painless ordeal using service worker and webmanifest, and that honestly suprised me. I dont know how feasible it will be but I will attempt to make future applications progressive web apps. Especially since it doesnt seem to be too much extra work when you have mobile first approach.

## Notes
Im really happy with this assignments final result. As a bonus I ran the app through lighthouse and added the requirements to the html file (like an apple touch icon and description) to see what it's score is and improve it. After the edits, I got some really cool scores.
